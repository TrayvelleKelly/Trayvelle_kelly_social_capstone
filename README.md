1:  Create a short overview of your application.
this is just a basic social site no logo no name just blank for me to add to it. I had a pervious project that was much better i just ran into too much errors, tried to fix it myself it ended horribly and got upset and deleted it entirely. So this basic site is the result of my frustration and rushing with 1 day to finish trying to figure it out myself instead of asking for help and not doing commits. i know i can do better i just didn't want to ask for help.
2:  Highlight the use cases of your application.
I just did the basic and used the use state to update posts and for email and passwords.
3:  Highlight the technical functionality of the application, from a high-level perspective.

4:  Discuss what you have learned through the development of the application.
I learned that the use state was harder than i thought in this and in my previous attempt at this i ran into alot of errors that messed with my other my other components 
5:  Discuss additional features that could be added to the application in the future.
i wanted to add a api to load random pictures of the the car of the user and a map api of the city where the car was located.
